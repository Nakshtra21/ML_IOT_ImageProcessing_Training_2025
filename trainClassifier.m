function [trainedClassifier, validationAccuracy] = trainClassifier(trainingData)
% [trainedClassifier, validationAccuracy] = trainClassifier(trainingData)
% Returns a trained classifier and its accuracy. This code recreates the
% classification model trained in Classification Learner app. Use the
% generated code to automate training the same model with new data, or to
% learn how to programmatically train models.
%
%  Input:
%      trainingData: A table containing the same predictor and response
%       columns as those imported into the app.
%
%  Output:
%      trainedClassifier: A struct containing the trained classifier. The
%       struct contains various fields with information about the trained
%       classifier.
%
%      trainedClassifier.predictFcn: A function to make predictions on new
%       data.
%
%      validationAccuracy: A double containing the accuracy as a
%       percentage. In the app, the Models pane displays this overall
%       accuracy score for each model.
%
% Use the code to train the model with new data. To retrain your
% classifier, call the function from the command line with your original
% data or new data as the input argument trainingData.
%
% For example, to retrain a classifier trained with the original data set
% T, enter:
%   [trainedClassifier, validationAccuracy] = trainClassifier(T)
%
% To make predictions with the returned 'trainedClassifier' on new data T2,
% use
%   yfit = trainedClassifier.predictFcn(T2)
%
% T2 must be a table containing at least the same predictor columns as used
% during training. For details, enter:
%   trainedClassifier.HowToPredict
